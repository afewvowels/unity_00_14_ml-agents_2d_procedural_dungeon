# Requirements

You'll need the following assets to properly compile this project:
1. Ondrej Nepozitek's (Procedural Level Generator)[https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/ProceduralLevelGenerator-Unity] Unity Package
2. 0x72's (16x16 Dungeon Tileset II)[https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii]
    * You can get it for free but I hope you feel really guilty about it!
3. pixel_poem's (Dungeon Tileset)[https://pixel-poem.itch.io/dungeon-assetpuck]

Just place those assets into your `/Assets/` directory and you'll be good to go!
